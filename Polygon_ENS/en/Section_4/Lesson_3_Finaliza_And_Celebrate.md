### **ðŸ™‰ A note on github**

**If uploading to Github, don't upload your hardhat config file with your private key to your repo. You will get robbed.**

I use dotenv for this.

```bash
npm install --save dotenv
```

```solidity
require('@nomiclabs/hardhat-waffle');
require('dotenv').config();

module.exports = {
  solidity: '0.8.10',
  networks: {
    mumbai: {
      url: process.env.STAGING_ALCHEMY_KEY,
      accounts: [process.env.PRIVATE_KEY],
    },
    mainnet: {
      chainId: 1,
      url: process.env.PROD_ALCHEMY_KEY,
      accounts: [process.env.PRIVATE_KEY],
    },
  },
};
```

And your .env file would look something like:

```
STAGING_ALCHEMY_KEY=BLAHBLAH
PROD_ALCHEMY_KEY=BLAHBLAH
PRIVATE_KEY=BLAHBLAH
```

(don't commit yourÂ `.env`Â after this lol, make sure it's in yourÂ `.gitignore`Â file).

Remember the change we made toÂ `.gitignore`Â earlier? You can now revert it by removing theÂ `hardhat.config.js`Â line, because now that file only contains variables representing your keys, and not your actual key info.

### ðŸš€ Deploy to the world

Deploying a React app has gotten so easy that there is no reason not to do it at this point lol. Plus, it'sÂ **free**. You've made it this far, deploying is the final step. Plus -- your fellow builders at buildspace must not be deprived of your awesome domains!! Please give us the opportunity to give you testnet money hehe.

Hereâ€™s a quick video Farza made on deploying via Vercel. If you don't want to use Vercel, all good. Use whatever you want.

Basically:

- Push your latest front-end code up to Github. Don't commitÂ `.env`.
- Connect Vercel to your repo.
- Make sure to set your root toÂ `app`.
- Add in yourÂ `.env`Â variables (since we won't be committing ourÂ `.env`Â file).
- Deploy.
- Done.

Note: On Vercel, you will need to add an extra environment variableÂ `CI=false`. This will make sure our build doesn't fail because of warnings.

### **ðŸ¥ž Careers in Web3**

Weâ€™re constantly seeing people nail their interviews at web3 companies after they do a few buildspace projects.

![https://i.imgur.com/QrFjlNH.png](https://i.imgur.com/QrFjlNH.png)

**People seem to think web3 just needs people who can code smart contracts or write code that interfaces w/ the blockchain. Not true.**

There is so much work to do and most of the work doesn't even have to do w/ smart contracts lol.Â **Being an engineer in web3 just means you take your web2 skills and apply them to web3.**

I want to quickly go over wtf it means to "work in web3" as an engineer.Â *Do you need to be a pro at Solidity? Do you need to know how every little thing about the blockchain works?*

For example, let's say you're a great frontend engineer. If you finished this project,Â **you have almost everything you need to be a great frontend engineer at a web3 company**. For example, the company may say "Hey â€” pls go and build our connect to wallet feature" â€” and you'd already have a solid idea on how to do that :).

I just wanna inspire you to work in web3 lol. This shit is awesome. And it'd be cool if you gave it a shot ;).

Be sure you click "Work in Web3" on the left and fill out your profile if you haven't done so already!!!Â **We're partnered w/ some of the best web3 companies in the world (ex. OpenSea, Chainlink, Edge and Node, and more) and they want to hire devs from the buildspace network :).**Â You've already picked up a skill that is actually extremely valuable and companies are paying top dollar for awesome web3 engineers.

### **ðŸ¤Ÿ Your NFT!**

We'll airdrop you your NFT within a day and will email you once it's in your wallet. It's running on a cron job! If you don't get the email within 24-hours pls pls pls drop us a message in #feedback and tag @Â **alec#8853**. Make sure you've submitted a link to your deployed project!

### **ðŸŒˆÂ Before you head out.**

Go toÂ **#showcase**Â in Discord and drop us a link to your final product that we can mess around with :).

Also, you should totally tweet out your final project and show the world your epic creation! What you did wasn't easy by any means. Maybe even make a little video showing off your project and attach that to the tweet. Make your tweet look pretty and show off!!

And if you feel up to it, tag @_buildspace :).Â **It gives us a ton of motivation whenever we see people ship their projects.**Â Plus, you can inspire someone else to get into web3.

Give us that dopamine hit pls.

Lastly, what would also be awesome is if you told us in #feedback how you liked this project and the structure of the project. What did you love most about buildspace? What sucked? What would like us to change for future projects? Your feedback would be awesome!

See yah around!!!
